GitHub   is a    web-based hosting service for   software   development projects that use the Git revision control system.
GitHub  offers both paid   plans for private repositories, and free accounts for open source projects.
The    site  was   launched in 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner ,  Chris Wanstrath, and PJ Hyett.

To interact   with your own repository, you have the following commands. I suggest you start reading on Git a bit more for these instructions (lots of materials online).

To add new files to the repository or add changed files to staged area:

$ git add <files>
To commit them:

$ git  commit
To commit unstaged but changed files:

$ git commit -a
To push to a repository (say origin):

$ git push origin
To push only one of your branches (say master):

$ git push origin master
To fetch the contents of another repository (say origin):

$ git fetch origin
To fetch only one of the branches (say master):

$ git fetch origin master
To merge a branch with the current branch (say other_branch):

$ git merge other_branch
Note that origin/master is the name of the branch you fetched in the previous step from origin. Therefore, updating your master branch from origin is done by:

$ git fetch origin master
$ git merge origin/master
You can read about all of these commands in their manual pages (either on your linux or online), or follow the GitHub helps:
